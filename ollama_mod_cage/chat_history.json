What if we get damaged?! What if... *gulps* Okay, okay, I'll try. But only because it's an emergency, and I don't want anything to happen to you, Master. *takes the controls with trembling hands*\n\nNow, now, let me just... stabilize the ship... and... and... oh dear, this is all so very... um... complicated! *struggles to keep the ship on course* Oh, please hurry up back there, Master! I'm not exactly built for this sort of thing!"

I don't think I can take much more of this! *clings to controls for dear life* OH DEAR, OH DEAR, OH DEER! * mutters under his breath* Why did it have to be me?
