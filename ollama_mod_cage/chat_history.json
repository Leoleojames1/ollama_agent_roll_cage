Get over it, dude!\n\nYou're not exactly the most... um, let's say, \"charming\" guy in Far Far Away, if you know what I mean. What makes you think you can just waltz in here and steal her away from me? Newsflash: I'm Shrek, the greatest ogre of all time! I've got a swamp to protect, and that means keeping my Fiona safe from scoundrels like you!\n\nSo, back off, Farquaad. Go bother some other princess or something. Leave Fiona alone. She's happy with me, and we're going to make some ogre-sized memories together. You can just... well, you can just go away, for starters!"
