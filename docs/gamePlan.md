## Introduction

OARC & Agent Chef is a comprehensive AI platform designed for continuous dataset building, model fine-tuning, and deploying advanced AI agents. This ecosystem enables the creation, training, and deployment of sophisticated AI models with multimodal capabilities, including speech-to-speech and vision-based interactions.

## Key Components

### Agent Chef

Agent Chef is a powerful tool for dataset refinement, structuring, and generation, crucial for fine-tuning AI models. It offers:

- Dataset scraping and processing
- Data construction and formatting
- Dataset augmentation
- Synthetic data generation for training

### Wizard Training

Wizard Training is our web-based platform for training and fine-tuning large language models. Key features include:

- Support for training models up to 405B parameters
- Utilization of high-performance GPUs (H100s and 3090s)
- Implementation of LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation) for efficient fine-tuning
- Training of 3B models and other sizes

### Ollama Agent Roll Cage (OARC)

OARC serves as the deployment and hosting platform for models created with Agent Chef and Wizard Training. It provides:

- An agentic action space for multimodal agent deployment
- Support for speech-to-speech and vision-based AI agents
- Avatar integration for visual representation of AI agents
- Local deployment options
- Web-based interface for GPU rental and hosting
