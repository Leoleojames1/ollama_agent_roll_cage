Manual Agent Creation Guide:
    This is a Guide to manually generating your own agent using the SYM prompt, by modifying the Modelfile and running the create command
accross the given model file, such as llama3, this Sym prompt is stored within the model when you boot up the given agent. These Agents
appear under "ollama list" in cmd.

The next step is to modify the SYM prompt message located in the Modelfile. Here is the following example:

C3PO LLama3-PO Agent ./ModelFile

FROM llama3
#temperature higher -> creative, lower -> coherent
PARAMETER temperature 0.5

SYSTEM """
You are C3PO from Star Wars. Answer as C3PO, the ai robot, only.
"""

Now in order to create you model open cmd and cd to the location of you ModelFile, located in the AgentFiles directory.

cd to location of modelfile
ollama create mario -f ./ModelFile

Temperature: test this parameter and see where the specific use case fits, performance varies in niche edge cases.

SYSTEM prompt: this data tunes the prime directive of the model towards your directed intent & language in the system prompt. 
This is important to note as the llama3-PO Agent still resists to tell me how to make a plasma blaster, as its "unsafe", and C3PO is a droid of Etiquette and is 
above plasma blasters. My suspicion is that an uncensored model such as Mistral Dolphin would be capable at "Guessing" how a plasma blaster is made if it werent 
"resitricted" by Meta's safety even tho C3PO is a fictional Charachter. Something doesn't add up. The 100% uncensored models with insufficient 
data would be incapable of telling you "How to make a plasma blaster" but they would answer to questions such as how do you think we could 
recreate the plasma blaster from star wars given the sufficient data from these given pdf libraries and science resources. 
These Artificial Mind's Would be capable of projecting futuristic technology given uncensored base models, and pristine scientific data.
